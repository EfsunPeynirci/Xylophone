# Xylophone App 🎶🐾

The **Xylophone App** is a fun and interactive Flutter project where users can tap on different animal images to hear their corresponding sounds. This project was inspired by **Dr. Angela Yu's The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart** course on Udemy, with a creative twist of using animal sounds instead of traditional xylophone notes.

## 📖 About the App
- **Purpose:** This app is designed to provide an engaging and educational experience, especially for children, by combining visual animal images with their respective sounds.  
- **How It Works:**
  1. The app features 7 animals: **Bird**, **Cat**, **Rooster**, **Cow**, **Dog**, **Donkey**, and **Lion**.
  2. Each animal has a corresponding button with a unique color.
  3. When a button is tapped, the app plays the sound of the respective animal.

This app demonstrates the use of Flutter's widget-based architecture, `audioplayers` package for sound, and simple yet effective design principles.
